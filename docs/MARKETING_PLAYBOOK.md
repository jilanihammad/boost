# Boost Marketing Playbook: TikTok, Instagram & Google Ads

## The Core Challenge

You're running ads **on behalf of merchants** to drive foot traffic. Your ad creative needs to:
1. Stop the scroll (attention)
2. Communicate the deal clearly (value)
3. Get the QR code saved/screenshotted (action)
4. Drive in-store redemption (conversion)

---

## Platform Strategy Overview

| Platform | Best For | Demographics | Ad Format Sweet Spot |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **TikTok** | Discovery, virality, Gen Z/Millennials | 18-34, trend-driven | Native-feeling UGC videos |
| **Instagram** | Visual deals, local discovery | 25-44, lifestyle-focused | Stories + Reels |
| **Google** | High-intent searchers | All ages, ready to act | Local Search + Maps |

---

## TikTok Strategy

### Why TikTok Works for Boost
- Low CPMs ($3-8 vs $15+ on Facebook)
- Algorithm favors engagement over followers
- QR codes feel native (people screenshot constantly)
- "Local hidden gem" content performs exceptionally well

### Creative Formats That Convert

**1. The "POV" Hook**
```
POV: You just found out [Coffee Shop] is giving away free lattes this week

[Show walking into shop, showing QR, getting drink]

Caption: Screenshot this QR before it's gone
```

**2. The "Wait What?" Pattern Interrupt**
```
"This coffee shop is literally LOSING money right now"

[Cut to: explaining the deal]

"They're giving $2 off every drink just to get new customers in the door. I'm not even sponsored, this is just a good deal."

[Show QR code for 3+ seconds]
```

**3. The Local Insider**
```
"Seattle coffee spots that locals don't want you to know about"

#1: [Shop name] - they have a secret $2 off deal right now
[Show QR, show the drink, show the vibe]

"You're welcome"
```

**4. The Staff/Owner Cameo**
```
[Owner talking to camera]

"Hi, I'm [Name], I own [Coffee Shop]. We're trying something new - scan this QR code and get $2 off your first drink. No strings, no app download, just show it at the counter."

[Hold QR code up]
```

### TikTok Ad Specs & Best Practices

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Length | 15-30 seconds (sweet spot: 21 sec) |
| Hook | First 1-2 seconds MUST stop scroll |
| QR Display | Show for 3-5 seconds, make it scannable |
| CTA | "Screenshot now" > "Click link in bio" |
| Sound | Use trending sounds OR talking head |
| Captions | Always on (85% watch muted initially) |
| Hashtags | #seattlefood #seattlecoffee #foodtok #[neighborhood]eats |

### TikTok Campaign Structure

```
Campaign: [Merchant Name] - Redemption Drive
├── Ad Set 1: Broad Seattle (18-34)
│   ├── Creative A: POV format
│   ├── Creative B: Local insider format
│   └── Creative C: Owner cameo
├── Ad Set 2: Neighborhood Targeting (Capitol Hill)
│   └── Same creatives, tighter geo
└── Ad Set 3: Lookalike (from redeemers)
    └── Best performing creative only
```

- **Expected CPM**: $5-10
- **Expected CPC**: $0.30-0.80

## Instagram Strategy

### Why Instagram Works for Boost
- Stories disappear = urgency
- Strong local discovery via location tags
- Older demo (25-44) with more disposable income
- Reels algorithm similar to TikTok

### Creative Formats That Convert

**1. Stories: The Countdown Deal**
```
Story 1: "48 hours only"
Story 2: [Show the deal - $2 off coffee]
Story 3: [Show the QR code - make it tappable/saveable]
Story 4: "Screenshot before it expires"
```

**2. Reels: The "Review" Format**
```
"I tried [Coffee Shop] so you don't have to"

[Walk in, order, show drink, take a sip]

"Verdict: Actually really good. And right now they have $2 off if you use this code"

[Show QR]

"Link in bio or just screenshot this"
```

**3. Carousel: The Deal Roundup**
```
Slide 1: "3 Seattle coffee deals this week"
Slide 2: [Shop 1 + QR code]
Slide 3: [Shop 2 + QR code]
Slide 4: [Shop 3 + QR code]
Slide 5: "Save this post for later"
```

**4. Static Post: The Clean Deal**
```
[Beautiful photo of the drink/food]

Caption:
$2 off any drink at [Coffee Shop]
Capitol Hill, Seattle
This week only

Screenshot the QR in the image. Show it at checkout. That's it.

No app. No signup. Just savings.

### Instagram Ad Specs

| Placement | Specs | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Stories | 1080x1920, 15 sec max | Add "Save" sticker prompt |
| Reels | 1080x1920, 30-60 sec | First 3 sec = hook |
| Feed | 1080x1080 or 1080x1350 | QR must be large & scannable |
| Carousel | 1080x1080, up to 10 slides | Deal per slide works well |

### Instagram Campaign Structure

```

Ad copy example:

## Cross-Platform Creative System

### The "One Shoot, Many Cuts" Approach

Film **one 60-second piece of content** and cut it for each platform:

```
Master footage (60 sec):
├── TikTok cut (21 sec) - hook + deal + QR
├── Instagram Reel (30 sec) - slightly more polished
├── Instagram Story (3x 15 sec) - teaser, deal, QR
├── YouTube Short (45 sec) - fuller story
└── Google Display (static frames) - best frames + QR
```

### Content Production Checklist

For each merchant, capture:
- [ ] Exterior shot (establishing)
- [ ] Interior vibe (ambiance)
- [ ] Hero product (the drink/food)
- [ ] Staff/owner sound bite (authenticity)
- [ ] Customer reaction (social proof)
- [ ] QR code display (clear, scannable)
- [ ] Address/location card (for Google)
