# Boost

**Boost** is a performance-based local growth product: merchants pay **per verified redemption** (no upfront SaaS fee).

## What it is (v0)
- **Consumer web**: find nearby offers, claim, show QR at register
- **Merchant web**: create offers, scan QR to redeem (manual code backup)
- **Backend**: verifies redemption, prevents fraud, tracks a ledger (what merchant owes)

## Docs
- `docs/PRD.md` — v0 spec + scope
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design + data model + flows
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — how to operate a pilot (onboard merchants, fraud checks, payouts)
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` — build plan

## Status
- Planning + spec first (don’t code blind). Next step: finalize pilot assumptions + build MVP.
